This was just a last min idea, all good if doesn't work for AND/OR! Also as a disclaimer, I dropped out of all my creative coding classes so I am all for code corrections. Was thinking you could exhibit with whatever font is being used on queertech.io? I would love for it to be hosted on the main exhibition page anyway (rather than externally) :) Again, no stress if it doesn't work! Thanks so much for your consideration <3 Zeth
