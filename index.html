<h1>Artist Statement</h1>
<br>
With increasing barriers to the Disability Support Pension (DSP), 36% of people currently on JobSeeker are disabled or sick (i.e. 1 in 3) and only 17% are exempt from fulfilling job application quotas, also known as “mutual obligations.” 
<br>
<br>
‘look!’ is a humorous critique on my experience as one of many JobSeekers who are unable to adequately demonstrate—or perhaps perform—their disability for a discriminatory welfare system. Supported by a song from the Centrelink hold line, ‘look!’ ruminates on the never-ending job hunt, the performativity of work, and the discomfort of being a trans JobSeeker. 
<br>
<br>
I am bending over backwards; I am looking for work; I am watching you back.
<br>
<br>
Come watch me look!
